## Prerequisites

### nodeJS

Using nodeJS provided method of install works, but a time will eventually come where you'll have to manage mulitple projects, with multiple nodeJS versions.
To ease the use of update and switching versions, we will use Node Version Manager.

**Download and install [nvm for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases).**

Use the latest `nvm-setup.exe` file and complete install.

- Open your prefered terminal with administrative rights.
- Run `nvm install latest`, and wait for download.
- Run `nvm use latest`.
- You can check what version of Node JS is installed with `node -v`.

> For more informations, consult nodeJS [documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).

### pnpm

Using pnpm is the recommended way to manage your node packages, creating aliases folders for reused packages, improved speed and better storage management.

In a terminal window with administrative rights:

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

To use it, replace your `npm ...` commands with `pnpm ...`.

> For more informations, consult pnpm [documentation](https://pnpm.io/pnpm-cli).

### Git and GitHub

#### 1. Git

Git is the software to manage, create and sync your filesystem with your GitHub account. It has a CLI based interface, but we'll use GUI clients like GitHub Desktop and Visual Studio Code integration to work with it.

**Download [64-bit installer](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install it.**

> For more informations, consult git [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs).

#### 2. GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is the official git GUI client from GitHub.
You will be able to create, clone, and update repositories, push and pull code, and manage multiple project easilly.

**Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).**

Once logged in with your GitHub account, use the <kbd>Add</kbd> button to:
|| Actions | Description |
|---|---|---|
|✅| Clone repository... | Get a list from your current cloud repositories, or clone one from an URL |
| | Create new repository... | Insantiate a new repository directly from the app. |
| | Add existing repository... | Sync a local repository to our GitHub account. |

For this project :
- After joining the repo as collaborator from the received invite :
- Use the first option `Clone repository...`, then:
- Select the existing `ecv-monsite` from your current repositories list.
- Choose a local folder where to copy the repository on your computer, and clone it.

Once the project is fetched, click <kbd>Open in Visual Studio Code</kbd> to launch the project.

#### 3. Visual Studio Code

> For a better workflow (auto-import, auto-completion, quick actions ...) with Svelte and Sveltekit in Visual Studio Code, we recommend the use of
> [this packaged plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=1YiB.svelte-bundle).

## Developing

### Installing dependencies

- In Visual Studio Code, open the integrated terminal <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>ù</kbd>. (It should be inside the main directory of this project.)
- Run `pnpm install` (or `pnpm i`) to install project dependencies.
- This will create a `node-modules` folder inside your main directory.

Depending on your internet connection and number of required packages, it may takes a minute or two.

### Live server

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies, start a development server:

```
pnpm dev
```

Follow the terminal prompts to open the server and start developing !

## Buildind and deploying

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

### Deploying

Using your GitHub account with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) free hosting service allows for a quick staging and production deployement to live url.
